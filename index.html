    <h3>14th February ❤️</h3>
    <p>
       My love, my dear sister,<br><br>
  You have a rare gift, the ability to make everyone feel seen, heard, and deeply valued.
  Your kindness doesn’t beg for attention, yet it leaves a lasting mark on every heart you touch.
  You give love so freely, so selflessly, without expecting anything in return,
  and that alone makes the world a softer, brighter place.

  You carry empathy in your words, warmth in your actions, and grace in your soul.
  Your presence brings comfort, your voice brings peace, and your heart brings healing.
  Knowing you, loving you, and calling you my sister is one of the greatest blessings of my life.

    <p>
    In every version of life,  
  in every possible world,  
  I would still choose you as my sister.

  Your love is steady and unwavering,
  your heart is pure and genuine,
  and your spirit carries a wisdom that goes far beyond words.
  You stand with strength, lead with kindness,
  and love with a depth that few people are capable of.

  You are a safe place, a source of light,
  and a reminder that goodness still exists in this world.
  I never take your presence for granted,
  because having you as my sister is a gift I will always cherish.
